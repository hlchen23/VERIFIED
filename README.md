The datasets and codes are coming soon.

[2024.10.22] ðŸš€ We update our webpage for our work VERIFIED! See https://verified-neurips.github.io

[2024.11.26] ðŸš€ We release our fine-grained dataset with its document.

[2024.12.22] ðŸš€ We release our features of our *-FIG datasets.

[2025.1.20]  ðŸš€ Since some users outside of China can not visit Baidu cloud, we release the features in Tsinghua Cloud.
